* Names: Max Ellsberry, Stephen Wimsatt, Mohammed Rasak, Andrew Burcroff
* This program is our Quad Solver, it will ask the user to input A, B, and
* C for the equation. Then it will determine if the three variables are
* valid. If found false it will ask the user for another input. If found true
* then it will print out the answer for those given variables. In the end it
* will return V1 and V2.
