IO Standards:
	Test for valid input
		Valid input is any non-negative float
	Test for invalid input
		Invalid input is any negative float or non-float character
	Test for buffer overflow
		Overflow occurs when any character string is greater than 100 characters

qSolve Standards:
	Verify that the algorithm for finding a discriminant is valid against accepted equations

mySqrt Standards:
	Verify that any discriminant greater than 0 returns the expected roots
