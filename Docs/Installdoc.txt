Once you have downloaded the 'QuadSovler' zipped file unzip the files to your desired directory.
Open a new shell and cd into the directory where you have extracted the files, and then cd into the 'Build' directory.
From the build directory use the command 'make build'.  This will build the dependecy files and place them in the build directory.
Once all the files are compiled, use 'make run' to run the program.
