Getting Started
	This file will the three floats that the user inputed will complete the square root. It will determine if the discriminant is greater than it will figure out the square root of the values. If the discriminant is equal to 0 then it will return -b divide 2 and times it by a. Finally, if the discriminant is negative then it will return a negative one. This will be done twice for both roots. 

Installing
	In Order for this program to run it will need: mysqrt, q.solve , IO and main .c files.  	

Running the tests

input: float a = 12.32, float b = 3.45 and float discriminant = -2

float  find the Root 1 (float a, float b, float discriminant){
	if(discriminant > 0)
		return (-b +sqrt(discriminant))/(2*a);
	else if(discriminant ==0)
		return -b/2*a;
	else
		print(“discriminant is is negative\n”);
		return -1;
}

Then it will return the last option 3 where it is negative and return a value of “-1” and “ Discriminant is negative”.
