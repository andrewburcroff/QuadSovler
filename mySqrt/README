the IO takes user inputs from the user. There should be 3 inputs that program will take in as floats in this case. 
If the number is invalid it will say that the input entered is invalid and ask the user to input correct input that
is valid.

Getting Started
	This file will calculate square root from the 3 floats given from the user. 
	If the discriminant is greater than zero it will figure out the square root of the values. 
	If the discriminant is equal to 0 then it will return -b divide 2 and times it by a. 
	If the discriminant is negative then it will return a negative one. This will be done twice for both roots. 

Installing
	In Order for this program to run it will need: mysqrt, q.solve , IO and main .c files.  	

Running the tests

input: float a = 12.32, float b = 3.45 and float discriminant = -2

float  find the Root 1 (float a, float b, float discriminant){
	if(discriminant > 0)
		return (-b +sqrt(discriminant))/(2*a);
	else if(discriminant ==0)
		return -b/2*a;
	else
		print(“discriminant is is negative\n”);
		return -1;
}

Then it will return the last option 3 where it is negative and return a value of “-1” and “ Discriminant is negative”.
