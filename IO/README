First the IO takes user inputs from the user. There should be 3 inputs that program will take in as floats in this case. 
If the number is invalid it will say that the input entered is invalid and ask the user to input correct input that is valid.

/*
 This file is used to get the input by the user and parses the arguments it also makes sure that the input is valid
