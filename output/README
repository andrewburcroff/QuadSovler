README

Once Main gets the return form mySqrt, it will send it to the output class where it print it off and determining 
if one root is equaling to negative 1 then it will say the root is complexing and write it out. If the root is not 
complex then it will say that it is not complex and print off the root.

Getting Started
	This file contains one method will take in a float and int, then method will determine 	if the num 
	is less than 0 it will say the float is complex. Else if the method will return the not complex.

Installing
	In Order for this program to run it will need: mysqrt, q.solve , IO and main .c files.  	
	Then main will send one float and one integer to this file called solution. The only 	
	method in the solution file, will check to see if the float is equal to -1, if so the the it 	
	will print off the root and number. This tells the user that this float is complex . Else 	
	the user is told the that the float is not- complex.

Running the tests

Input: float = 16.14 and num = -1

Void checkSolution (float a, int num){
	if(a==-1){
		printf(“Root: %i \n”, num);
	}
	else {
		print(“Root: %i%.7lf \n” num, a);
	}
}

The output would be return -1 saying that the float wold be complex.
