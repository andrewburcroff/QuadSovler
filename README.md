# QuadSovler
This is our first project in Senior Design where we are design our own Quadratic equation.

Getting Started
	QSolver will accept 3 floats as part of ax^2 + bx + c and determine the roots for the associated quadratic equation.

Installing
	From the build directory using the command 'make build' will generate the source object files and copy them to the build directory to create the QSolver executable. Using the command 'make run' will run the exectuable in the current shell. 

Running
	The program will first ask the user for 3 non-negative float inputs. If any of the inputs are negative it will prompt the user to try again. Once all three inputs are acceptable, it will find the discriminant of the equation and then find the correspoding roots. If any or all of the roots are complex, then they are notified that the answer is complex. Once the answers are output, the program closes.
